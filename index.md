I am a **PhD student** of Astrophysics in the University of Valencia and my research mainly focuses on Machine Learning techniques for modelling of gravitational wave signals.

My main projects are:
- Surrogate model for gravitational wave signals from quasi-circular BBH mergers.
- Modelling of the postmerger part of the gravitational wave signal of BNS mergers.
- Recovery of primitive variables in Numerical Relativity simulations using Neural Networks.
- Shock breakout estimation for type II supernovae, to be used in targeted searches for gravitational waves counterparts.

**Older projects:**
- Photometric redshift estimation of SDSS galaxies using Convolutional Neural Networks.
- Hubble tension, Dark Energy parameter constraints and H(z) deformation models.
